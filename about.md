# TexturePlatformerButtons
### <cr>***__No, this mod doesn't help you accurately "restore"/"re-create" the original platformer button textures reused from GDPS 2.2 Unlocked/Forlorn. And it probably won't ever will.__***</c>
<cy>***"So, America, don't cry because it's over. Smile because it happened. And then probably cry a little bit." --Colin Jost, December 2020***</c>

<cy>***__Windows/macOS users__***: ***Please also install [Prevter's Platformer UI Tweaks mod](mod:prevter.platformer-ui-tweaks) and make sure its  `Enable Touch UI`  setting is enabled,*** *__otherwise this mod is barely better than a paperweight.__*</c>

Texture each Platformer UI button individually with images (`.png` files) of your choice! Assign separate textures for when a button is held as well. <cy>(For best results, try not to use file names/file paths containing non-English characters.)</c>

*__This mod does not come with its own presets for platformer UI buttons; go find images on your own. <cy>(Images are automatically re-sized to fit within the original button's width or height.)</c>__*
